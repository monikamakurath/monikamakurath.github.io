    <h1>Hi.</h1>
    <p>My name is Monika. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at  HHMI Janelia where I study 
      carbohydrate metabolism in cells. I grew up in a minority culture of Kashubia
      whose people live one with nature, and I've been captivated by trying to understand how nature
      works ever since. I am also a first generation college student and a first generation American. 
      The generational patterns of addiction, poverty, and mental disorders have closely affected 
      my family, and as a result they have strongly impacted my thinking. I deeply care about people 
      and nature, and I try to understand both through my research.
      I got B.A. at Loyola University and Ph.D. at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
      My Ph.D. research focused on studying the biophysical mechanisms of DNA unwinding using 
      single-molecule approaches. During my postdoc and in my future research, I choose to focus on 
      metabolism because it is fundamental to all life and it is tightly connected to behavior, diet, 
      and diseases and predispositions affected by lifestyle choices. </p>
