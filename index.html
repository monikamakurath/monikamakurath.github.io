    <p>Hi. My name is Monika. I am a postdoctoral researcher at  HHMI Janelia where I study
      carbohydrate metabolism in cells. I grew up in a minority culture of Kashubia
      whose people live closely with nature, and I've been captivated by how nature
      works ever since. </p>
      
   <p>I am also a first-generation college student and a first-generation American. 
      The generational patterns of addiction, poverty, and mental illness have closely affected 
      my family, and strongly impacted my thinking. As a result, I care deeply about both 
      people and nature, and I try to understand both through my research. </p>
    
    <p>I earned my B.A. from Loyola University in Chicago and my Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 
      where I studied biophysical mechanisms of DNA unwinding using 
      single-molecule approaches. During my postdoc and in my future research, I focus on 
      metabolism because it is fundamental to all life and it is tightly connected to behavior, diet, 
      and the ways our evironments and choices influence our health. </p>
